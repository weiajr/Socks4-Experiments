# Socks4 Experiments

This repository contains a collection of SOCKS4 servers and a test client. The main components are **CSProxyServer**, a high-performance C# implementation, and **ESProxy**, an ESP32 C++ implementation that I developed for fun. There is also **ProxiedDownloader**, a simple streaming tool for downloading files.
